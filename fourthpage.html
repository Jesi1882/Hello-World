<h1> Pickles are a great way of preserving natures bounty. </h1>
<p>If you insist on eating things that weren't animals, <br/> 
 I suggest pickles. <br/>
  Technically, if you use some whey to ferment your pickles, <br/>
  then there are animals in there in the form of bacteria. <br/> 
yes they are small, but theres still billions of them. </p>
