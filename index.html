    Sausages are really awesome. Meat itself is pretty delicious, <br/>
 but so much of an animal is not able to be cut into steaks, roasts or other sundry cuts; </br>
racks of ribs,blood, all the amazing little muscles in an animal's face. </br>
Sausage is what makesuse of all these leftover bits </br>
  as well as trimmings, and stuffs them into the animals intestines.
  </br>Not only is it delicious, its quite economical too.
